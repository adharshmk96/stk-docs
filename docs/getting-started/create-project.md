# Create a project

To start a project, you need to run the following command:

```bash
stk init 
```

and then run

```bash
make run
```

or 

```bash
go run main.go serve -p 8080
```

to start the server in port 8080. 

test the server using: 
```bash
curl localhost:8080/ping
``` 

> Hint: You can pass the package name in an empty directory eg: `stk init github.com/adharshmk96/stk`

You can run this command in 
- Empty directory : Given argument will be used as  package name ( or it generates random name ).
- Go module directory : The go module name will be used as the package name.
- Git repository : The repo name will be used as the package name.


This will create the project structure and add the required files. read about the structure [here](/getting-started/project-structure)

### Tools

[goreleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) is used for building and releasing the project. The default configuration for goreleaser is generated by default.

Mock generator ( for testing ), [mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) is reccomended.

For semantic versioning, [semver](https://github.com/adharshmk96/semver) is reccomended.
