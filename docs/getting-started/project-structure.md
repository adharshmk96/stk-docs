# Project Structure

The philosophy behind this project structure is to parition between different segments for modules such as 

- Domain : Core data structures and interfaces for the module.
- Service : Business logic for the module.
- Storage : Storage implementation for the module.
- API : Http handlers and helpers for the module, for handling REST API.
- Web : Http handlers and helpers for the module, for handling Web UI.
- Serr : Errors for the module.

Each segment should be mutually exclusive of each other, The dependencies should never cross the segment boundaries. Each segment is injected (dependancy injection) at routes.go setup file in the module.

Then, the server level concerns such as routing, middleware, and infrastructure are separated from the core logic.

### Internals

The internals directory contains the modules, and their Implementation for each segment. The modules are separated into different directories:

Structure:

Module: `internals/<module-name>`

- `domain` - Core data structures and interfaces for the module.
- `serr`  - Server specific errors for each modules.
- `api` - Http handlers and helpers for the module, for handling REST API.
  - `/handler` - Http handler functions for each modules which process the request and response. Implements the interfaces defined in `domain` for each modules.
  - `/transport` - Data structure and Functions related to http response, for each modules.
- `web` - Http handlers and helpers for the module, for handling Web UI.
- `service` - Business logic for each modules. Implements the interfaces defined in `domain` for each modules.
- `storage` - Storage implementation for each modules. Implements the interfaces defined in `domain` for each modules.
- `routes.go` - Setup file for each modules, where the dependencies are injected (dependancy injection) for each modules.

### Server

The server directory contains logic related to platform level concerns, such as:
- Server configurations
- Middleware
- Routing
- Infrastructure

Structure:

- `server/infra` - Server configurations and constants.
- `server/middleware` - Middleware functions for the server.
- `server/routing` - Routing logic for the server, Binds the http handlers to the routes for each Modules.
- `server/server.go` - Server initialization and start logic.

---

### Cmd

- `cmd` - Command line interface related files (using Cobra CLI).
  - `cmd/root.go` - Root command for the project.
  - `cmd/serve.go` - Serve command runs the server, starts the server in configured port.

---

### Public

- `public` 
  - `/assets` - Static assets such as css and javascript.
  - `/templates` - Static templates for the server ( used for rendering html pages ).
  
---

### Platform Configurations

- `.github/workflows` 
  
  For github workflows, The default workflow for build, test, release is generated by default. Go releaser is used to execute the release job. Release workflow is triggered when a new tag is pushed to the repository.

- `.vscode`

  For vscode configurations, such as launch.json. The default launch configurations for debugging is generated by default.
